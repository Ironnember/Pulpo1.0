# Pulpo

Pulpo is the governance and evidence plane between AI intelligence and consequential execution. It turns explicit intent into deterministic governance, binds allowed work to narrowly scoped one-use permits, and preserves durable evidence for verification and reconciliation.

This repository is the clean canonical Pulpo project. The older `Iron-Ember/pulpo` repository remains historical reference material; its accumulated plans, generated evidence, machine-specific scripts, and CI workarounds are intentionally not imported here.

## Proven now

The base dependency-free suite and optional asymmetric-authority suite prove:

- unknown, incomplete, and over-budget intents fail closed;
- selected high-impact actions require a verifier-backed approval envelope;
- authority policy pins verifier, key, algorithm, public-key fingerprint,
  deployment, and maximum approval lifetime;
- optional Ed25519 verification contains public material only and exposes no
  signer;
- caller-controlled boolean approval and authorization timestamps are absent
  from the evaluation API;
- permits are bound to the exact intent and cannot be replayed;
- an optional SQLite state backend preserves approval-ID, nonce, permit, and
  audit state across process restart in the same canonical kernel;
- persisted audit-chain tampering fails closed when the kernel restarts;
- configured agent roles cannot exceed their action, resource, or cost grant.
- a bounded domain order is bound to its full request, quote, reserved budget, and one-use permit.
- a configured external verifier checks v2 approval envelopes bound to trust,
  deployment, intent, policy, principal, session, nonce, issue time, and expiry
  using the kernel's trusted clock.
- transactional SQLite commerce state preserves reservations, attempted orders,
  reconciliation, and spend across restart.

PulpoGit provides a read-only clarity projection for local source state. It
distinguishes canonical, proposal, stale, diverged, detached, and dirty
checkouts without inferring tests or authority. See the
[PulpoGit clarity proof](proofs/git_clarity/README.md).

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Minimal example

```python
from pulpo import GovernanceKernel, Intent, Policy

kernel = GovernanceKernel(
    Policy(
        allowed_actions=frozenset({"read", "write"}),
        max_cost=100,
    )
)

intent = Intent("agent:builder", "write", "repo:README.md", cost=5)
decision = kernel.evaluate(intent)

if decision.outcome == "allow":
    assert kernel.consume(decision.permit, intent)
```

## Boundary

Pulpo currently proves governance, pinned asymmetric external-verifier contract
semantics, local restart-safe kernel replay state, and restart-durable bounded-
commerce state with dependency-free SQLite backends. It does not yet claim an
independently deployed human signer, trusted verifier bootstrap, rollback-proof
host storage, a real payment rail, network isolation, hostile-code sandboxing,
distributed identity, or production readiness.

## Host bound and Pulpo bound
Pulpo is only as secure as the host it is running on. The kernel, permit store, and evidence journal assume that host is still the host that was installed and that it is still enforcing process, file, and boot policy. Pulpo does not own the boot chain, firmware, NVRAM, unused or hidden partitions, storage-controller firmware, the management controller, service-account privileges, or the decision to keep operating a machine that can no longer be measured. An OS reimage, snapshot, or rollback does not restore those layers. A compromised host can skip the process, replace local state, or omit a record. That is an operator incident, not a Pulpo control failure.
Pulpo is accountable for the contract it states, on a host that is still enforcing it: unknown, incomplete, and over-budget intents fail closed; a permit is bound to one exact intent and cannot be replayed; loss of contact does not widen a grant; uncertain execution remains unknown and does not become retry authority; a visible broken audit chain fails closed. A defect in that contract is a Pulpo failure. Survival of host compromise, rollback-proof storage, trusted verifier bootstrap, network isolation, and hostile-code sandboxing are not part of that contract.
